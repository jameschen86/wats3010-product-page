          <h1>Learn about Discovering Eternity</h1>
          <p>The world has always been composed of four region. The supreme militant-driven nation to the west, the
               traditional
               magical academy to the east, the crime driven slum of the south, and technological advance metropolis of
               the
               north. In attempt to promote unification of the four nations, young Kari was selected to join a squad of
               explorers
               with three other young adults from the remaining three regions. The group makes a discovery of a
               lifetime,
               and
               ancient civilization predating all four nations. As her group returns to report their discover she finds
               one
               of
               their fellow members dead, with her and two other explorers as the prime suspect.</p>

          <h1>Chapter 1</h1>
          <p>They were a bad match. Kari had knew that when she first the other members of her group from other regions
               for a
               long expedition of exploring the unknown jungle that flourished in the deep crater of the land. The
               crater
               was in
               the middle of each of their regions untamed and untouched by any hint of civilization. It had been a
               month
               since
               they have explored the region together and they have yet yield any significant discovery except
               extending the
               topography.

               The group composed of a representative from other regions of the world, each of them a hand chosen
               talent.
               being
               picked among many to be part of this group. With that honor, came a sense of superiority. All of them
               had an
               attitude, and their personality constantly clashed on a daily basis. Their speciality consist of a
               scout, a
               foreman, a recorder, her the reporter.

               Viv the other girl from the group came from the southern region. While they were both female, the
               similarities end
               there. Where as Kari preferred planing for her action, Viv base her on actions on instincts without any
               basis
               or
               reasoning. What makes Viv hard to deal with is her spontaneity and selfishness. As she lead them down
               the
               path
               that was treacherous to all but most lithe human, namely only her. “A short cut” she casually remarked
               as she
               leap
               from one foothold to another as Kari “almost slip” far too many times to her liking. In the end Kari and
               the
               other
               two member demanded that Viv find them a safer route, but not before receiving the look fro Viv. The one
               you
               receive when someone sees you as incompetent. But what really draw the line, was when Viv decided to
               make
               Kari her
               mark. Kari had a necklace given to her by mother on her birthday. Viv and her cat-like eyes on it, the
               moment
               they
               met, just a couple days ago, the necklace vanish during her sleep. With only the four of them in the
               middle
               of
               nowhere, it narrows down the list of suspect to three with only one of them coming from a nation where
               kleptomania
               as a common trait among their people.

               Arnold the representative from the west was the foreman and in charge of supplies, and begun to order
               the
               other
               three members as if they were in the military corp. What he failed to understand was none of them came
               from
               military, and none of them respond well with bellowing and spit droplets landing on their face when he
               came
               to
               close to their face. Now that Kari thought about it perhaps all this barking and chest pounding was
               needed
               for
               him, as Arnold had never resorted to physicals force to her. But it was certainly not by choice, he was
               given
               specific instructions that he was not to harm any of the members to risk international conflict. They
               all
               were
               instructed the same. Whenever Kari questioned his methodology, she could see it took every strain of
               muscle
               on his
               body to hold back the urge to resort to violence, which she no doubt is second nature to him. Kari was
               not
               afraid,
               all she saw was a overbearingly man, whose only methodology was using force to get obedience. It seem
               that
               today
               his energy was focus on the final member Garret for avoiding.

               Garret, the representative from the north, who just shrug when Arnold growered him on, as if he were a
               mutt
               barking at him. Garret was the lazy one, who. There is in fact such a thing as being too passive. Kari
               could
               not
               figure out what the lanky man’s thoughts were. Garret was indeed a savant at mapping, but with social
               decorum
               were
               that of a hermit.

               All three of them had an ego, and Kari knows that she had one also. Arrogant, disobedient, and obsessive
               is
               what
               her colleague had described non too discreetly behind her back. She is aware of her flaw, and was trying
               to
               repress her nature for the sake of teamwork. That however could not be applied to the rest of the team
               mates.
               With
               each passing day with only each other as company. She was convinced that one of them was going to
               smoother
               them in
               their sleep and call it an accident. If this continues she may be the one that does to smothering.
